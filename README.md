> Technical founder building AI-powered systems for healthcare

## About Me

I'm CTO and co-founder at [Pickle](https://withpickle.com), where we're building the data infrastructure for healthcare recruiting. We process millions of healthcare professional records using LLM-powered entity resolution and enrichment, helping recruiters find and verify candidates faster.

Before Pickle, I architected data platforms and AI systems powering £9M products and led enterprise digital transformations for global financial institutions and FTSE 100 companies. Now I'm focused on what happens when you combine messy real-world data with modern AI to deliver simple systems that deliver measurable results. 

## What I am Building: 

🥒 [Pickle](https://withpickle.com) — Healthcare recruiting platform with LLM-powered entity resolution and enrichment across licensing, credentialing, and professional data. 

💒 [OSWP](https://github.com/dccakes/SCV) - opinionated copy of The Knot in NextJS as my partner and I prepare for our wedding. 

🦾 [Scrape GPT](https://github.com/dccakes/scrape-gpt) - Intelligent web scraping system that combines deterministic XPath extraction with LLM-powered adaptation. 

🏥 **npi-mcp** — MCP server for NPI database access *(coming soon)*

## What I Do

- **Build with LLMs** — Entity resolution, intelligent scraping, agent workflows in production
- **Work with customers** — Technical founder who's done sales, onboarding, and support
- **Ship in regulated domains** — Healthcare credentialing, licensing data, compliance constraints
- **Lead small teams fast** — Startup-speed execution with enterprise-grade thinking

## Current Focus

- LLMs in production — Entity resolution, data enrichment, and intelligent recruitment at [Pickle](https://withpickle.com)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) — Building tools that connect AI systems to real-world data
- Healthcare data architecture — Person-centric data models over fragmented licensing systems
- [Open Data Contract Standard](https://github.com/bitol-io/open-data-contract-standard) — Technical Steering Committee member

*"Building systems in the messy middle between AI capabilities and real-world constraints is like city planning: transportation, utilities, and zoning all have to be intentionally designed for the city—and the business—to actually work."*
